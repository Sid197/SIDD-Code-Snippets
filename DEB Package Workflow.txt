DEB Package Workflow


Prepares the environment (permissions, directories, configs).
control : Is a metadata file. It contains the some imp details about the data e.g. Description,Maintainer/owner, Dependencies.
postinst:[postinst is file that is run after the installation of docker services ]


/usr/bin/mywebsite.sh && setup.sh are to be saved in /usr/bin/ for system-wide accessiblilty.  

This file runs after installation use from --> /usr/bin/setup.sh
setup.sh [This is a main setup script]--->
Setup file is responsible for  initilziation of downloading / creating  docker services.
Every service has its own dockerfile and docker yaml file.

It holds info of version or release of web application.
Tells or directs the docker file to storage mount point for video recordings.

If "0.0.0.0:2375 /lib/systemd/system/docker.service" this is already created in root directory it tell tell dockerfile that port for docker is already opened or expose.
2375 is port used for docker. 


Environment setup using setup.sh file:
Running setup.sh likely launches these with Docker.
These scripts call Docker Compose to spin up infrastructure.
The package ships docker-compose YAMLs for different services (Kafka, Redis, Kong API gateway, Monitoring stack, DB, etc.).


/usr/share/redx-installer : 
/home/easemyai/installer_new_linux/redx-installer/usr/share/redx-installer --> 
create_topic.sh ---> creates various  topics using kafka services required for vms.
kafka.sh --> remove or deleting mounts of kafka.

For user management and for storing other essential data mongo database is used .
[init-mongo.js] ----> Connecting to mongo db service.

In monitoring _configs:
There are monitoring services used and there configurations yaml file are there
grafana_data
promethe_data
promtail


In [config.ini]:
Save user-specific settings and customizations for a program. 

redis ---> redis is used used for cache memory [redis-entrypoint.sh  ] file is used .


Dockerfiles:
docker-compose.db.yml
docker-compose.kafka.yml
docker-compose.kong.yml
docker-compose.monitoring.yml
docker-compose.prod.yml
docker-compose.redis.yml
This above mentioned docker compose yaml files contains each service's configurations.

Kong:
kong_setup.sh ----> is used for connecting microservices with each other and it also connects frontend with backend with API's . 


stop.sh ---> to down or remove docker stack from services.
