SSHFS(Ollama)

**SSHFS Tutorial**

**Prerequisites:**

*Root or Sudo access on client and server
*SSH access to both systems
*Knowledge of current mount points and shared dir.

Step1: Client-Side Setup
1.Install OpenSSH (if not already installed) on the client:
sudo apt install openssh-client

2.Create a mount point for the SSHFS share :
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sshfs

3.Mount the SSHFS share using following command(replace '192.168.1.14' with your server's IP address):
sudo sshfs 192.168.1.14:path/to/share /mnt/sshfs

4.Verify the mount
df -h | grep sshfs
mount | grep sshfs  


Step 2: Server-Side Setup
1. Install OpenSSH (if not already installed) on the server:
sudo apt install openssh-server

2. Create a directory to share using SSHFS:
sudo mkdir -p /path/to/share

3. Configure SSHFS shares by adding the following line to `/etc/exports` (replace `192.168.1.121` with your client's IP address):
/path/to/share 192.168.1.121(ro,async,no_subtree_check)

4. Apply the export configuration:
sudo exportfs -arv


Step 3: Testing and Verification
1.Test SSHFS connectivity from the client:
ssh 192.168.1.14
cd /path/to/share

2.Verify that files can be accessed and written:
echo "Hello from SSHFS" | sudo tee /mnt/sshfs/test.txt


Step 4: Unmounting the SSHFS Share
1.Stop any service using the SSHFS mount:
sudo systemctl stop [service-name]

2.Unmount the SSHFS share:
sudo unmount /mnt/sshfs

3.Verify that the mount is no longer present:
df -h | grep sshfs
mount | grep sshfs


Step 5:Cleaning Up
1.Remove any temporary files or Dir:
sudo rm -rf /path/to/share/temp

2.Remove the SSHFS mount point dir (if its no longer needed):
sudo rmdir /mnt/sshfs

3.Cleanup SSHFS packages (optional):
sudo apt remove sshfs
sudo apt autoremove
